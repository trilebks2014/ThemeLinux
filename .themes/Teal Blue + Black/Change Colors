To change the teal blue color to any other color, copy the teal blue + black folder (it can be found in ~/.themes), name it what ever you want the theme name to be, then open that new folder, open gtk-3.0 folder, open gtk.css, find @define-color selected_bg_color, and change #0093c0 (the teal blue color) to any color you want. In settings.ini find \nselected_bg_color:, then change #0093c0 to the color you used before.  Then go back to the first folder, the one with gtk-3.0, open gtk-2.0, open gtkrc find nselected_bg_color: (it's in line 5) and change #0093c0 to the color you used the other two times.    


note: this will not change the color of the close button in the metacity theme, or the colors in the cinnamon theme.
